**SMOKED DUCK SALAD WITH FRIED CAYENNE PASTA-** Ann Nelson

Adapted from “The New Texas Cuisine**”** 

**Serves 4-6**

Salad Ingredients:

6 ounces skinless smoked duck breast, cut into small chunks

2 tablespoons finely chopped red pepper

2 tablespoons finely chopped carrot

2 tablespoons finely chopped jicama

3 tablespoons finely chopped mango

2 tablespoons red seedless grapes, cut into eighths

3 tablespoons sugar snap peas, blanched in boiling water for 30-60 seconds, drained and finely chopped.

4 tablespoons toasted pine nuts (toast in 300-325 degree oven, checking frequently after the first 3 minutes.

1/3 cup or more of Herbed Mayonnaise (recipe follows)

Salt and pepper to taste

Putting It Together*:*

Combine all the ingredients in a medium bowl. Add the 1/3 cup herbed mayonnaise, stirring to combine. Taste and season with more mayonnaise if desired and salt and pepper.

Ingredients for Herbed Mayonnaise: 

1 egg yolk (use a pasteurized egg if you’re concerned about salmonella)

¼ teaspoon salt

Juice of ½ lemon

½ cup olive oil

½ cup canola oil

1 small shallot, diced

1 tablespoon chopped cilantro

1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon chopped basil

2 teaspoons chopped chives

Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

Putting It Together:

In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, ¼ teaspoon salt, and lemon juice until just blended. Slowly drizzle in the olive and canola oils while whisking continually. After all the oil is incorporated, continue whisking for 15 seconds or so to ensure the mixture is combined. Add the shallot and fresh herbs. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

*Ingredients for Cayenne Pasta:* 

1 cup flour

½ cup semolina flour

2 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika

1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

¾ teaspoon salt

2 eggs

1 tablespoon tomato paste

½ tablespoon olive oil

1 quart vegetable oil for frying

Combine the flours, paprika, cayenne and salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, tomato paste and oil until blended. With the processor running, pour the egg mixture through the top of the processor lid and blend until the dough is just evenly mixed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, gather into a ball, and pat into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and allow tostand at room temperature for 1 hour.

You can roll the pasta dough by hand or by using a pasta machine. To roll by hand, divide the dough into two pieces, and roll the pieces one at a time with a rolling pin, into a large rectangle, using a small amount of flour to keep the dough from sticking, until the dough is 1/16” thick. Cut the dough into long, thin strip using a pastry wheel or sharp knife.\*


To roll the dough using a pasta machine, divide the dough into six pieces. Roll the pasta through the machine, adjusting the machine after each run, starting with the widest setting and dusting with flour if needed, until the pasta is 1/16” thick. Run the sheets through the linguine blade to cut.

Lay the cut pasta on a clean towel or cloth, allowing it to dry for approximately 30 minutes.

Heat the oil in a deep fryer or large heavy bottomed pan until it reaches 350 to 375 degrees. Fry the pasta in batches for 10-15 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. (The pasta can be fried a day or two ahead and stored in an airtight container at room temperature.)

*Putting the Salad Together:* 

Divide the duck mixture evenly amongst 4-6 plates. Decoratively arrange a cluster of the fried pasta over it. Drizzle some additional herbed mayonnaise around the plate if desired. Garnish with a fresh cilantro sprig if available.

**ROSEMARY FLATBREAD WITH CARAMELIZED ONION, GOAT CHEESE, AND PECANS HORSERADISH GRILL.**

For dough:

¼ oz pkg active dry yeast

2 cups warm water (105 degrees)

1/8 tsp sugar

4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

5 to 5 ¼ cups all purpose unbleached flour

2 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary leaves

1 tbsp salt

Other ingredients:

2 lbs large onions, sliced thin

½ stick unsalted butter

¾ pound soft mild goat cheese, crumbled

¾ cup pecan pieces

1 tbsp fresh rosemary

¼ cup extra virgin olive oil

For flatbread dough: In a large bowl of a standing electric mixer whisk together yeast, ¼ cup warm water, and sugar, and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 2 tbsp oil, remaining water, and 3 cups flour, and stir until flour is moistened. Fit mixer with a dough hook or paddle attachment and beat mixture on low speed until combined well. Stir in rosemary, salt, and remaining flour until flour is moistened, and beat mixture on low speed until it forms a soft sticky dough, adding another ¼ cup flour if necessary. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough 1 minute. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled deep bowl, turning to coat with oil, and let rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place, until doubled, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Oil a 16 by 12 by 1 inch jelly roll pan with remaining oil and turn dough out onto pan. Pat dough out to fit pan. If dough 

resists, let rest 5 minutes. Let dough rise uncovered, in a warm place until doubled, 40 minutes- 1 hour. 

While dough rises, in a large heavy skillet, cook onions in butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden and caramelized, about 15 minutes, and cool to room temperature. Remove light bulbs in oven. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Scatter onions, goat cheese, pecans, and rosemary over dough and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle oil over dough and spritz lightly with water from a spray bottle. Bake flatbread in middle of oven, sprinkling lightly with water every 10 minutes, until crust is golden and cooked through, 20-25 minutes. Transfer flatbread with a metal spatula to a large rack and cool 5 minutes. Cut into 8 rectangles and halve each.\*

**GOAT CHEESE AND VEGETABLE RAVIOLI IN CITRUS TOMATO BROTH AND FRIED LEEKS-**Emeril Lagassi

Ravioli: 
1/2 of the roasted vegetables, minced, recipe follows 
4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
3 sheets fresh pasta, about 10 by 12 inches 
1 egg, lightly beaten 
Roasted vegetable broth, recipe follows 
Melted leeks, recipe follows 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. 

In a mixing bowl combine the minced roasted vegetables, goat cheese, salt and pepper, and mix well. Lay 1 sheet of fresh pasta on top of a ravioli form, placing half on the form and the other half hanging off onto the work surface. Place 1 tablespoon of vegetable filling in the center of each ravioli hollow. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the areas between hollows with some of the beaten egg. Fold the sheet of pasta over so that the ravioli "pockets" are covered. Using a rolling pin, roll over the ravioli form with firm pressure to seal the raviolis and to perforate pasta between each ravioli. Remove excess pasta from the edges, and check to make sure the raviolis are properly sealed. Repeat the entire procedure with the remaining 2 sheets of pasta. 

Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add the ravioli in batches and cook until just done, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the ravioli with a slotted spoon, place 3 on each serving plate, and top each serving with 1/2 cup broth and a large dollop of the melted leeks.

**PORK TENDERLOIN WITH DRIED CHERRY SAUCE AND BLUE CHEESE PINE NUT TOPPING**-  Ann Nelson



1 large shallot, minced

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 cup dried cherries, divided

1 tablespoon sugar

½ cup dry red wine

½ cup ruby port

1 1/3 cups veal demi-glace (see note below)

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature



1 ½ pounds pork tenderloin

vegetable oil

Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste



½ cup toasted pine nuts (toast in a 300-325 degree oven, checking after 3-4 minutes and every minute after)

1 cup heavy cream

2 ounces good quality blue cheese, crumbled



2 tablespoons fresh chives, snipped



` `Heat a medium skillet or saucepan with a small amount of oil.  Add the garlic and shallots, and cook for half a minute or less to soften.  Add ½ cup of the dried cherries along with the sugar, and cook 1 minute longer.  Deglaze the pan with the red wine and port.  Allow to reduce at a slow boil by three-quarters.



Cool the cherry mixture slightly, and then puree in a food processor until smooth.  Add the mixture back to the large skillet, and stir in the demiglace.  Add the remaining cherries to the skillet, and bring the mixture to a simmer.  Simmer for 3-5 minutes (longer if desired).  Whisk in the butter, and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Brush or rub the pork tenderloin with a light coating of vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place in a roasting pan, and roast until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees, approximately 20-25 minutes.  Allow the pork to rest 10 minutes before slicing.



When the pork is almost done roasting, place the pine nuts and cream in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, and bring the mixture to a slow boil.  Proceed to the next step in the recipe while reducing the cream by one third, checking the mixture frequently to make sure it doesn’t boil over. 



While the cream is reducing, warm the cherry sauce over medium-high heat.  Slice the pork into medallions.



Whisk the blue cheese into the reduced cream and plate the dish.  Ladle a small amount of cherry sauce on each plate and top with two or three pork medallions.  Place a generous dab of blue cheese-pine nut mixture on top of each medallion and garnish with fresh chives.\*

**FALL FRUIT CRISP WITH CRANBERRIES -**Country Desserts

2 pounds cooking apples

2 pounds Bartlett or Anjou pears

4 ounces dried cranberries

2 tablespoons bread flower

3 tablespoons lemon juice

1/4<sup>th</sup> cup honey

Topping

5 ounces bread flower

3 ounces rolled oats

5 ounces light brown sugar

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon,

6 ounces firm unsalted butter

Peel, core, and cut the apples and pears in half.  Cut each half into 3/4-inch chunks.  Place the apples, pears, and dried cranberries in bowl and toss to combine.

Combine the 2 tablespoons of flour and the lemon juice.  Add the honey and then combine with fruit cubes and cranberries, tossing to combine well.  The lemon juice will keep the fruit from turning brown and add nice flavor as well.

Press fruit pieces into a 10-inch cake pan, including any liquid.

Prepare topping by combining the remaining flower, rolled oats, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flower mixture, mixing just until the topping starts to come together; it should still be lumpy.  Sprinkle the topping over the fruit mixture.

Bake at 375 F. for approximately 50 minutes.  the apple and pear chunks should be soft and the liquid released by the fruit during the initial cooking stage should be reduced to a small quantity of syrup.  To check on the fruit and amount of liquid, carefully lift off a small piece of the topping and look inside.  If the fruit needs to cook further and/or there is too much liquid, continue baking and check again.  If the topping is already brown, cover the pan to protect the top.  Serve warm, accompanied with bourbon sauce, if desired.
